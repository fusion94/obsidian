- Summary: Apple’s stinginess with the amount of RAM in the new base model MacBook Pro 14 continues to be a story, with news today that vice president of worldwide product marketing Bob Borchers defended it by saying “8GB on an M3 MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16GB on other systems” with no actual evidence to back that up. This is the same amount of RAM found in a $600 Mac Mini or a sub-$1000 MacBook Air, but here applied to a $1600 MacBook Pro. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Apple silicon and unified memory is impressive but it’s not magic and working memory is still working memory. If you are doing any sort of multitasking, like one might expect to do with a $1600 laptop that has Pro in the name, you will quickly run into limits with 8GB of RAM. Don’t buy the hype.
