## Highlights
- Vagrant brings configuration automation all the way down to the developer’s desktop. With it, you can package the same operating system that runs in production — along with the same configuration automation scripts — in a form that’s easily shared among developers. Instead of spending the first two days on the job installing software, a new development team member can spin up a production-identical environment on their laptop simply by typing vagrant init then vagrant up.
