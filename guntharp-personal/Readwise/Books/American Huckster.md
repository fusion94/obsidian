## Highlights
- Blazer, who could have been a contender himself, never considered the presidency seriously because he was convinced that a “white man” couldn’t head an association of largely Caribbean and Latin American organizations, he told a confidant. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=666))
- After 1991, the two were off to the races: Blazer would admit to taking bribes for the rest of the Gold Cups during his CONCACAF reign. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=681))
- Andrew Jennings’s book The Dirty Game: Uncovering the Scandal at FIFA, published in September 2015, alleges that Dempsey, who died in 2008, was paid $400,000 in New Zealand currency, or about $250,000, to abstain. ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1417))
- Back then, Blazer “facilitated” a bribe to Warner—which he in turn shared with Blazer—in exchange for a vote for Morocco by insinuating to certain Moroccan officials that pay for play was the FIFA way. And, of course, it was. ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1529))
- “We didn’t know then the cost. And particularly the cost to Nelson Mandela, shipping around the world to satisfy the craving of some two-bit crook, who just happened to hold the balance of voting power.” That was perhaps a little unfair to Warner, who was much more than a “two-bit” crook. After all, he’d already stolen more than $25 million from FIFA, from CONCACAF, and even from his own friend and criminal partner, Blazer.

- A book published in April 2015 by Sunday Times reporters Jonathan Calvert and Heidi Blake titled The Ugly Game: The Corruption of FIFA and the Qatari Plot to Buy the World Cup, describes how bin Hammam was a pivotal figure in a shadow campaign to bring the Cup to Qatar. There is no question that he played a huge role in the downfall of Blazer and Warner, but he also had his defenders. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1722))
- “Did bin Hammam pay bribes? Oh God, yes. He always had a man standing by with bags of cash,” said one investigator. “At least it was his own money.” ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1784))
- Austin had called Blazer’s decision to hire Collins “inexcusable and a gross misconduct of duty and judgment”—and fired Blazer, telling him in a letter, “It is apparent that you are no longer fit to act as general secretary of CONCACAF.” ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1958))
- By June 4, Austin had been booted—banned provisionally by CONCACAF and FIFA from soccer activities—and ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1972))
- On July 7, just over two months after the envelopes had changed hands in Port of Spain, FIFA issued Freeh’s findings: there was “compelling circumstantial evidence” that bin Hammam and Warner had colluded to buy votes. FIFA banned the men from soccer for life. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=1996))
- This was it. Federal officials finally had the leverage on an American citizen they could use to bust open a case against FIFA corruption. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2047))
- Blazer collected at least $20 million from 1990 to 2011, with $15 million of that branded by investigators as “misappropriated.” Blazer’s reported commissions soared from $195,000 in 1992 to $5 million in 2011. ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2204))
- The integrity committee also examined Blazer’s $29 million in charged expenses over seven years, discovering that he paid off only $3 million in personal expenses in a kind of financial shell game by simply reducing the amounts he “claimed” CONCACAF owed him in commissions that he wasn’t actually allowed to collect, according to the investigative report. ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2214))
- In one final shocker, investigators also found that Blazer not only dodged paying his own taxes but also “willfully” failed to file federal tax returns for CONCACAF from 2006 to 2010, as required by law, and paid no taxes on the association’s separate CMTV subsidiary from 2004 to 2010. CONCACAF lost its tax-exempt status temporarily as a result. ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2231))
- Court documents released by Swiss authorities in 2012 would reveal that bribes paid to various FIFA and federation leaders from 1989 to ISL’s bankruptcy totaled more than $100 million, with Havelange and Teixeira collecting $41 million for awarding rights to just the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2660))
- “It was a dirty decision to put a World Cup on a strip of sand that was broiling,” ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2779))
- IN QATAR, A VERY DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF VICTIMS—AN ARMY OF POWERLESS IMMIGRANT workers—has become the most wrenching casualty linked to the controversial pick for the World Cup. ([Location 2861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2861))
- Qatar remains one of only three Arab countries—along with the United Arab Emirates and Oman—that did not ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. ([Location 2905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B014165ZVW&location=2905))
