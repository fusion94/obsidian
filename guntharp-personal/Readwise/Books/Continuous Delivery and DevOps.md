- The presumption here is that the problems identified are the common place issues related to most software delivery processes: Waste in having too many handover and decision points in the process Waste due to unnecessary wait time between steps Many software changes are packaged up into large, complex big bang releases Large and infrequent releases breed an environment for escaped defects and bugs Releases are seen as something to dread rather than a positive opportunity for change People are disengaged or there is low morale (or both) Software changes are not trusted until they have been tested many many times Over complex dependencies within the software design Tasks which are duplicated throughout the process ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009ZUECSW&location=740))
