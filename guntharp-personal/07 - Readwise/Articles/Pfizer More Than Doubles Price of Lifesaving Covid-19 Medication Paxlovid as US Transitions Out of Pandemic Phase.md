## Highlights
- The price of the lifesaving Covid-19 antiviral medication Paxlovid will more than double as the United States transitions out of the emergency phase of the pandemic, drugmaker Pfizer said Wednesday.
  The list price, before insurance, will be $1,390 for a five-day course, Pfizer said in a statement. Thatâ€™s 2.6 times higher than the $530-per-course price paid by the US government, which provided Paxlovid free to patients during the pandemic.

- The change in list price comes as the US transitions from a system in which the government purchased the medication and provided it free to everyone to a more traditional commercial marketplace. Paxlovid will continue to be free for patients through that system until the end of the year. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd43y3b2wd4ejv24pg1x18ct))
