## Highlights
- There was one thing, though, I knew to expect: calls for “restraint.” They come after each terrorist atrocity against Israel, and this case was no different. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcjz841s7f68z61wd9rf4hrd))
- hese calls are not merely inappropriate and one-sided, but genuinely evil. This pogrom transpired precisely because Israel was pressured into listening to previous calls for “restraint.”
  Think about it: Not once have world leaders called for restraint from Ukraine. History records no cries for de-escalation as British and American bombers reduced Dresden to rubble while fighting the Nazis, allied forces pummeled Iraq, or American troops hunted Osama bin Laden. Nor should there have been. None of the aforementioned world leaders or members of Congress call for restraint when fighting totalitarians or terrorists — unless the victims are Jews.

- Israel must fail no longer. Referring to Hamas, Netanyahu claimed Israel will “defeat them to the end,” but mollified this by saying Israel would destroy the “capabilities” of Hamas. No. The presence of Hamas alongside Israel places every Israeli civilian in jeopardy; it is far overdue for that danger to be removed. Israel must utterly destroy Hamas, and this war cannot end until the white flag of surrender flies from the pile of concrete that was once the Hamas center of operations.
  Anything else would be a moral failing of disastrous proportions, one that will surely bring future horrors in its wake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcjz9bgfb3nxw1nx5a5ekh0n))
