## Highlights
- Never before had the death of a chief executive affected people so intensely. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=236))
- Currently, Alabama doesn’t have explicit laws barring discrimination on the grounds of race, age, or sexuality. Shortly after Cook was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor in 2014, he personally told Representative Todd that Apple had no intention of investing in Alabama until the state passes antidiscrimination laws. “Citizens of Alabama can still be fired based on their sexual orientation,” Cook said. “We can’t change the past, but we can learn from it, and we can create a different future.” ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=512))
- In 1998, Cook got rid of tens of thousands of unsold Macs, which had carelessly piled up in the days before Apple’s turnaround, by sending them to a landfill. The episode is shrouded in mystery, and understandably, Apple kept it very quiet. It’s at odds with the environmentally friendly principles that Cook has instilled at Apple today.

- Forstall played a lot of politics, often took credit for others’ work, pushed coworkers aside to get ahead, and caused a lot of friction. He was also nakedly ambitious, which alienated him from coworkers. “He wanted to be involved in too many things that weren’t his business,” ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=1372))
- Heather White, a New York–based documentary filmmaker of Complicit, a film about terrible working conditions in Apple’s supply chain, took the hardest line of all. She questioned why Apple is in China at all. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=1563))
- “As many of us prepare to celebrate the holidays with our loved ones, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on what we’ve achieved together over the past year,” ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=1762))
- Cook and Sewell met with Eric Holder and Jim Cole, then the deputy attorney general, in late 2014, and FBI agents told them they were “interested in getting access to phones on a mass basis.” This was way before the attack in San Bernardino, and Apple made it clear from the start that they were not going to grant the FBI access to hack into Apple users’ phones. Cook and Sewell told Holder and Cole that they “didn’t think that that was an appropriate request to be made of a company that has as its primary concern the protection of all citizens.” They had a similar conversation with Lynch and Yates.

- “Because of that, you really need to have a deep understanding of cultures around the world.” He added, “I have learned to not just appreciate this but celebrate it. The thing that makes the world interesting is our differences, not our similarities.” ([Location 2724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=2724))
- “I try to look at myself in the mirror and ask myself if I’m doing enough,” he said. “And if the answer is no, I try to do something more.” ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=2743))
- Most of Apple’s current leaders have been in place for decades and will likely remain so for years to come. ([Location 2774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=2774))
- Many of Apple’s staff will be in their jobs for twenty years or more, and it might take decades for the workforce to change its makeup. ([Location 2775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=2775))
- Apple under Cook has launched its own Everyone Can Code initiative, which offers a comprehensive curriculum to help teach coding to students from Key Stage 1 to university. It includes everything from teacher guides and lessons to coding resources and access to educator forums—all based on Swift, the open-source programming language designed by Apple.

- “The best, smartest designers and architects in the world could have tried something new,” the article noted. “Instead it produced a building roughly the shape of a navel, and then gazed into it.” ([Location 3107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLVCT2J&location=3107))
- When I visited the Park in March 2018 for a series of executive interviews, I found the building impressive but sterile. Like many of Apple’s big retail stores, the building itself is imposing, but the uniformity of wood and stone makes it lifeless. Everything inside is built to the same specification—all the tables, chairs, stools, and coffee bars are the same. All the work pods have the same layout and office furniture. It’s uniform on a gigantic scale, and there’s nothing quirky or human about it. It’s a giant, perfect cathedral of concrete and glass: exacting in every detail but devoid of humanity.

- Coming out was a brave act of civil duty. Cook is likely the most private man at the world’s most visible company, yet he sacrificed a portion of his own privacy for the greater good. By coming out publicly, he allowed a lot of marginalized people to take courage in their identities. He helped to further normalize gay people, showing that a gay man can quite competently run the world’s biggest company.
