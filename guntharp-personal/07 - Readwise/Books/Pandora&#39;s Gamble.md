## Highlights
- it was “noted that the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” the cable said. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8YYD7S3&location=57))
- In private, however, some of the world’s elite scientists saw a lab accident as a very real and horrifying possibility. They knew what the public didn’t: Lab accidents happen with shocking frequency, even at the world’s best-run labs.

- Researchers in China had just published a paper in the Lancet describing some of the first cases17 of the new disease. Of these initial forty-one cases, only twenty-seven had a history of exposure to the Huanan market. And the earliest of these known cases, a patient who became ill on December 1, 2019, had no link to the market.

- Despite the initial big headlines that fed into the narrative that the lab hypothesis was the stuff of tinfoil hats, it would later be disclosed that the WHO team had done no meaningful investigation of the possibility of a research accident, yet still drew its conclusions.

- the members never reviewed the laboratory notebooks, incident reports, or volumes of other records that might have shed light on whether a lab origin should legitimately be ruled out.39 Instead, they were comfortable making this important finding based on conversations where assurances were made—scientist to scientist—by those who were operating the labs at the center of the controversy.

- that concluded the pandemic was “more likely than not, the result of a research-related incident.” ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8YYD7S3&location=306))
- One thing is certain. If the pandemic began with a lab accident in Wuhan—or even if the public and world leaders believed it was the likely source—it would be the biological equivalent of the nuclear industry’s Three Mile Island or Chernobyl. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8YYD7S3&location=330))
- Much of what is known today about how biological research laboratories should safely work with dangerous microbes can be traced to the work of Wedum and his colleagues. They did groundbreaking studies to determine who at Camp Detrick—and at labs across the United States and abroad—was getting sick and why.
